CodeEditor Component
The CodeEditor component provides a textarea for code input with syntax highlighting using PrismJS.

Styling
The app uses CSS styles for layout and syntax highlighting, defined in App.css.

GitHub Integration
A GitHub button is placed at the top of the app to link to the project repository.

Troubleshooting
Issue: Cursor behaves unexpectedly in the code editor.
Solution: Ensure only one instance of the CodeEditor component is rendered.
Future Improvements
Add theme switcher for syntax highlighting.
Implement code linting and error checking.

Step 1: Set Up Your React Project
Install Node.js: If you haven't installed Node.js, download and install it from nodejs.org.

Create a React Project:


npx create-react-app simple-code-editor
cd simple-code-editor

Install Dependencies:

npm install prismjs prism-react-renderer

Step 2: Create the Code Editor Component
Create a New Component: Create a new file named CodeEditor.js in the src folder.

Import Necessary Libraries:

javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Prism from 'prismjs';
import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css'; // Import PrismJS theme
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer';
Define the Code Editor Component:

Step 3: Use the Code Editor Component
Modify App.js:

javascript

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import CodeEditor from './CodeEditor';


Step 4: Run Your Application
Start the Development Server:


npm start
View Your Application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see a simple code editor with syntax highlighting
